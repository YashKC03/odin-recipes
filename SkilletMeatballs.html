    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These skillet meatballs are tender on the inside and have a neutral taste, so they can be used any way you like â€”in pasta, soup, sandwiches, or as appetizers.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 onion</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, beat egg, and add in 1 tablespoon milk. Stir in panko breadcrumbs; let stand for 1 minute to soften slightly. Add ground beef.</li><br>
        <li>Place onion in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. </li><br>
        <li>Add onion, Parmesan, garlic, salt, and pepper to the bowl of ground beef. Using clean, gloved hands, combine mixture gently. If mixture feels tough, add 1 tablespoon milk. Shape mixture into 1 1/2-inch meatballs. </li><br>
        <li>Heat oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Place meatballs in a single layer, without crowding, into the skillet, and cook, turning and moving them around every 2 or 3 minutes, until well browned on all sides and no longer pink at the center, 10 to 14 minutes, adjusting temperature as needed. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). You may have to cook meatballs in batches.</li><br>
        <li> Remove meatballs to a foil-lined drip tray. Serve with pasta and sauce if desired. </li><br>
    </ol>
